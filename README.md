# Map Drop  

Map Drop is a Node.js/CreateJS application build to allow users in different locations to add and modify icons onto a shared map.  Original Drupal back-end code has been removed for simplicity. 
# Features
Node.js Socket.IO functionality 
  * Navigate to "/node-server/playfield.js" and run the following:
    ```sh
        $ node playfield
  - Open your browser and navigate to the index.html page. 
  - Open a different browser and navigate to the index.html page. 
  - After preloader runs in both browsers, start adding and moving icons around and watch the behavior replicate throughout all open browsers.
